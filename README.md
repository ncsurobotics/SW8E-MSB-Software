# SW8E-MSB-Software

Microcontroller Code for SW8 Manipulation Systems Board (MSB)

Designed for MSP430FR2355 chip (same as used on the MSP430FR2355 launchpad: MSP-EXP430FR2355)

Use this Arduino core: [Arduino-Core-MSP430](https://github.com/MB3hel/Arduino-Core-MSP430)

Official energia will not work due to servo library incompatibility and incomplete support for this chip. It is also abandoned at this point.
